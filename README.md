Hello :smile: and welcome to my hw03 repo

In this assignment, I manipulated and explored a dataset with the `dplyr` package, complemented by visualizations made with `ggplot2`, also applied `grid` `gridBase` `gridExtra` to make fancy tables , also table and figure side-by-side. Besides, I use `reshape2` packages to form a new table.
